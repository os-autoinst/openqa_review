A review helper script for openQA.

For more details read the documentation within `openqa_review/openqa_review.py`.

  such as [VirtualEnv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

or if you are using openSUSE distribution, it is recommended to use `zypper`,
